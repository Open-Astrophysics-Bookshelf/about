# the Open Astrophysics Bookshelf

## What is it?

The Open Astrophysics Bookshelf is a collection of astrophysics textbooks
that are open-licensed and open to contribution for others.

Books are written in LaTeX and licensed using a creative-commons
license.  Each text will be its own repo under the OAB organization
page.  Texts would be free to adopt whatever style they want, but
should accept contributions from the community (via pull-requests).
Contributions should be noted through a hierarchical author lists with
the lead author/curator being the one who started and wrote most of
the text and guides the theme of the text, contributing authors who
wrote chapters or large sections, and then community authors who fixed
typos or made smaller changes.  In addition to explicit
acknowledgements of contributions in the texts themselves, the git log
will always keep track of contributions.

The books would be living, in the sense that they'd continually
evolve.  Different texts could either stamp editions (via a git tag)
from time to time or just record the git hash in the PDF.  With the
source available, we could also produce versions optimized for tablets
vs. screen vs. printed-page from the same source.


## How can I contribute?

You can add to an existing text by forking it, making corrections,
improving some discussion, or writing a new chapter, and then issue
a pull request to have your changes incorporated into the main repo.

If you have your own book that you would like to add to this bookshelf
that create an Issue under the `oab_organization` repo requesting that
a new repository for your text be created.
